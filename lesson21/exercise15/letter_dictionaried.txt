okay 
i
know
you
have
competing
priority  
and
that
you 
organization
has
grown
and
that
maybe
this
is not
the
most
important
thing
on
you 
agenda
any
more   
the
thing
is 
you 
competition
might
actually
act
like
the
thing
that
the  are
doing
is
their
only
job 
the 
might
believe
that
in
fact 
treating
this
customer
as
if
she is
the
only
person
in
the
world
is
worth
it 
that
fixing
that
squeaky
door 
addressing
that
two year
old
bug
in
the
software 
or
taking
one
extra
moment
to
look
someone
in
the
eye
and
talking
to
her
with
respect
is
worth
it 
we
do not
become
mediocre
all
at
once 
and
we
rarely
do
it
on
purpose 
instead 
we
start
believing
that
the
entire
project
is
our
job 
not
this
one
thing 
this
one
thing
we
use 
to
do
so
brilliantly 
the
day
the
organization
install 
the 
 you 
call
is
very
important
to
us    
message
is
the
day
that
the 
announce
to
themself  
who
the 
are
becoming 
customer 
rarely
care
about
you 
priority   
getting
bigger
is
supposed
to
make
us
more
effective
and
efficient 
alas 
the
way
to
get
there
is not
by
doing
what
you
use 
to
do 
but
less
well
