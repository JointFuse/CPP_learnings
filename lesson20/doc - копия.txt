Post-mortem mode. This is the default mode.The mode does not need 
interaction with the host side.In this mode tracing module does 
not check whether host has read all the data from HW UP BUFFER 
buffer and overwrites old data with the new ones. This mode is 
useful when only the latest trace data are interesting to the user, 
e.g. for analyzing program’s behavior just before the crash. Host 
can read the data later on upon user request, e.g. via special 
OpenOCD command in case of working via JTAG interface.
