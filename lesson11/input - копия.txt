Post-mortem mode. This is the default mode.The mode does not need 
interaction with the host side.In this mode tracing module does 
not check whether host has read all the data from HW UP BUFFER 
buffer and overwrites old data with the new ones. This mode is 
useful when only the latest trace data are interesting to the user, 
e.g. for analyzing program’s behavior just before the crash. Host 
can read the data later on upon user request, e.g. via special 
OpenOCD command in case of working via JTAG interface.

Streaming mode. Tracing module enters this mode when host connects 
to ESP32. In this mode before writing new data to HW UP BUFFER 
tracing module checks that there is enough space in it and if 
necessary waits for the host to read data and free enough memory. 
Maximum waiting time is controlled via timeout values passed by 
users to corresponding API routines. So when application tries to 
write data to trace buffer using finite value of the maximum 
waiting time it is possible situation that this data will be 
dropped. Especially this is true for tracing from time critical 
code (ISRs, OS scheduler code etc.) when infinite timeouts can lead 
to system malfunction. In order to avoid loss of such critical data 
developers can enable additional data buffering via menuconfig 
option CONFIG_APPTRACE_PENDING_DATA_SIZE_MAX. This macro specifies 
the size of data which can be buffered in above conditions. The option 
can also help to overcome situation when data transfer to the host is 
temporarily slowed down, e.g due to USB bus congestions etc. But it 
will not help when average bitrate of trace data stream exceeds HW 
interface capabilities.
